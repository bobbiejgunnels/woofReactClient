        <h2>I wanted to challenge myself with a React App and combine my love for dogs!</h2>
        <h3 className="aboutcontent">My name is Bobbie Gunnels and I was raised in Anniston, Alabama. I moved to Birmingham when I was 16 years old for a short two years before I made my 23 hour voyage to Denver, Colorado where I was first introduced to software develpment. I wore out my snowboard and camping gear the four years I spent in the Wild West. After I got my fill out the Rocky Mountains I moved back home to Birmingham to be closer to my family and settle down. I worked as a dog groomer and found my husband and lovely step-son. I will be looking forward to finding my first job in my new career as I have enjoyed every minute of developing my skills in True Coders. </h3>
